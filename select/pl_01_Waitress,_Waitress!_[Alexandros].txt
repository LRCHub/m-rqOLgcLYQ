the night is getting deep and
the light fades away
people run away from the dark
and the gohst
the party had just started now
open the gate
ring the bell and let all the
people come in
the light is getting blighter
now take off your cost
I can see your sweet dripping
down from your neck
the party has just started now
bring me the wine
ring the bell and let all the
people enjoy
Until the right will be killed
by the day
I will be standing right next
your soul
Sing out the sorrow we'll play
if for you
It's time to get rid of the
pain,
the bane, and drain
It's my pleasure to be with you
and you tonight
the night is getting higher and
the fire is low
people dry and smile for the
little things in life
the party has just started no
time for a break
ring the bell and let all people
begin
the light is getting brighter
now I see your face
I can say it's the most
beautiful thing in the world
the party has just started now
wipe out your tears
ring the bell come on let's
begin all the show
Until the moon will be killed by
the sun
I will be singing  right next
your soul
Sing out out the grief  we'll be
chasing the note
It's time to get rid of the pain
the bane, and drain
it's my pleasure to be with you
and you tonight
I fell in love with a goal with
a red  shoed and red dress
She was waitress at the diner
and everything was fine as a
wine
didn't know what word I should
to choose to make her mine
without buying pair of shoes I
just held her and gave her my
storing kiss
Everything stopped the time the
rain the conversation fight at
the bar
I can say it was the most
beautiful moment in the world
But all the sudden everything
started to move and she gave me
the biggest punch ever I broke
my teeth and finally my heart
too
Until the night will be killed
by the day
I will be standing right next
your soul
Sing out the sorrow we'll play
it for you it's time to get rid
the pain, the bane, and drain
It's my pleasure to be with you
and you tonight

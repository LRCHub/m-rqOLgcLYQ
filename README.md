```lrc
[00:23.32] The night is getting deep and the light fades away
[00:27.99] People run away from the dark and the ghost
[00:31.26] The party has just started now open the gate
[00:34.61] Ring the bell and let all the people come in
[00:49.97] The light is getting brighter now take off your coat
[00:53.64] I can see your sweat dripping down from your neck
[00:56.81] The party has just started now bring me the wine
[00:59.94] Ring the bell and let all the people enjoy
[01:08.40] Until the night will be killed by the day
[01:11.96] I will be standing right next to your soul
[01:15.42] Sing out the sorrow we'll play it for you
[01:18.18] It's time to get rid of the pain
[01:20.94] The bane, and drain
[01:22.35] It's my pleasure to be with you and you tonight
[01:37.68] The night is getting higher and the fire is low
[01:41.38] People cry and smile for the little things in life
[01:44.67] The party has just started no time for a break
[01:47.99] Ring the bell and let all the people begin
[01:51.17] The light is getting brighter now I see your face
[01:54.37] I can say it's the most beautiful thing in the world
[01:57.56] The party has just started now wipe out your tears
[02:00.76] Ring the bell come on let's begin all the show
[02:06.76] Until the moon will be killed by the sun
[02:09.54] I will be singing right next to your soul
[02:12.65] Sing out the grief we'll be chasing the note
[02:15.70] It's time to get rid of the pain
[02:18.42] The bane, and drain
[02:19.92] It's my pleasure to be with you and you tonight
[02:37.10] I fell in love with a girl with a red shoed and red dress
[02:39.93] She was waitress at the diner and everything was fine as a wine
[02:42.70] Didn't know what word I should to choose to make her mine without buying pair of shoes
[02:46.37] I just held her and gave her my strong kiss
[02:49.49] Everything stopped, the time the rain the conversation, fight at the bar
[02:53.39] I can say it was the most beautiful moment in the world
[02:55.40] But all the sudden everything started to move and she gave me the biggest punch ever
[02:58.91] I broke my teeth and finally my heart too
[03:09.07] Until the night will be killed by the day
[03:12.97] I will be standing right next to your soul
[03:16.40] Sing out the sorrow we'll play it for you
[03:19.34] It's time to get rid of the pain
[03:21.94] The bane, and drain
[03:23.54] It's my pleasure to be with you and you tonight
